## Overview

Behavioral theories of leadership suggest that leadership skills and behaviors can be learned and trained, rather than being innate qualities or traits. In 1945, researchers at Ohio State University conducted studies to identify the specific behaviors exhibited by effective leaders, moving away from the traditional focus on inherent personality traits. 

The Ohio State leadership studies identified two independent dimensions of leader behavior:
1. **Consideration**
2. **Initiating Structure**

These two dimensions focus on how leaders balance interpersonal relationships and task management in leadership roles.

## Consideration

**Consideration** refers to the extent to which a leader shows concern for the well-being of group members. This dimension emphasizes interpersonal relationships, mutual trust, and creating a supportive environment. Leaders who exhibit a high degree of consideration are focused on the needs and feelings of their team members, making this a people-oriented leadership style.

## Initiating Structure

**Initiating structure** refers to the degree to which a leader defines and organizes the roles of both the leader and group members, initiates actions, and outlines how tasks are to be accomplished. This dimension is task-oriented and focuses on ensuring that work is organized and that team members understand their responsibilities.

Key characteristics of a leader high in initiating structure include:
- Clearly **defining roles** and expectations for the group.
- Organizing group activities and planning how tasks are to be completed.
- **Assigning tasks** to specific group members.
- Setting and maintaining **standards of performance**.
- Emphasizing the importance of meeting **deadlines** and achieving goals.

Leaders high in initiating structure ensure that the teamâ€™s goals are clearly defined and that each member knows their role in achieving those goals. This leadership style is particularly important in situations where
