Servant leadership is a leadership philosophy in which the goal of the leader is to serve.

As stated by its founder, Robert K. Greenleaf, a servant leader should be focused on "Do those
served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more
autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?

This is different from traditional leadership where the leader's main focus is the thriving of their
company or organization.

A servant leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and
perform as highly as possible. Instead of the people working to serve the leader, the leader exists
to serve the people.

A number of different organizations including Starbucks and Marriott International have adopted
this style as their way of leadership

Servant leadership

The authors proposed three key elements that captures the essence of servant leadership and set it
apart from other leadership styles â€“

namely the motive (the underlying personal motivation for taking up a leadership responsibility,
requiring a strong sense of self, character, and psychological maturity),

the mode (that they lead by prioritizing subordinates' needs above the organization's bottom line),
and

the mindset (that servant leaders are stewards who reorient their followers' focus towards others).

In essence, servant leadership comprises the following:

(1) someone or something other than the leader, (2) one-on-one interactions between leaders and
followers, and (3) an overarching concern towards the wellbeing of the wider organizational
stakeholders and the larger community.[1
